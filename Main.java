/* Java Variable Types
You have 5 types of variables in Java
Boolean: Only 2 states True/False 
Integers: Int, always WHOLE numbers
Strings: Text, ex "Hello"
Floats: Decimals, ex; 19.99 or -19.99
Char: Single Characters, ex "a" "B", WRITE A CODE THAT GIVE YOU HOW MANY CHARACTERS ARE IN "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"


In math x=4 means 4=x
In programing x=4 ( 4 is assigned to x)

x="patty"
b= "Tomato"
c= "Cheese"
d= "Bread"
e=" Lettuce"
f= "Ketchup"
g= "Mayo"

So the template is: type variable = value;
